## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


ex2 = as.dist(matrix(c(0, 0.3, 0.4, 0.7, 0.3, 0, 0.5, 0.8,0.4, 0.5, 0.0, 0.45,0.7, 0.8, 0.45, 0.0), nrow=4))

plot(hclust(ex2, method="complete"))

plot(hclust(ex2, method="single"))

plot(hclust(ex2, method="complete"), labels=c(2,1,4,3))
